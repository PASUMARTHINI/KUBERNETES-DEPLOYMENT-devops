DESCRIPTION : 
Microservices architecture divides an application into small, independent services that communicate through APIs. Each microservice runs in its own container, enabling independent scaling, deployment, and fault isolation. Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform, automates the deployment, scaling, and management of these containerized services. The first step in deploying microservices on Kubernetes is preparing the Kubernetes cluster. This involves setting up nodes, configuring network policies, and ensuring role-based access control (RBAC). Tools like Minikube, kubeadm, or cloud-managed Kubernetes services like AKS, EKS, or GKE can be used to create and manage the cluster. fter YAML files are prepared, you apply them to the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl commands:
kubectl apply -f <file.yaml> deploys the microservices.
Kubernetes creates pods and ensures their lifecycle is managed according to the Deployment definitions.
Health checks for microservices are configured through readiness and liveness probes, ensuring they respond appropriately before being included in load balancing.
